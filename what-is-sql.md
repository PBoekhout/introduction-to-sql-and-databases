# What is SQL?

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a special language designed to work with data stored in relational databases. It helps you talk to the database so you can organize, find, and change the information inside it. With SQL, you can:

- **Create** a new database or add a new table for storing information.
- **Insert** new records, like adding a customer's details or a product listing.
- **Select** and retrieve existing data, such as looking up all the orders placed today.
- **Update** existing records to fix mistakes or change details.
- **Delete** data you no longer need.

In other words, SQL is like the “common language” that lets you ask questions about your data and make changes to it in a clear, predictable way. It’s widely used in many industries, making it a valuable tool for anyone who needs to work with data.

We will be going over some of the simpilar commands for SQL statments in the next page. such as create, select, update and delete!
