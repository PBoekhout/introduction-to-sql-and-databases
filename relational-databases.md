# Relational Databases

A **relational database** stores data in tables, which are structured with rows and columns. Each table represents a specific entity (like 'Customers' or 'Orders'), and relationships can be established between tables.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Table**: A collection of related data entries.
- **Row (Record)**: A single data item in a table.
- **Column (Field)**: A set of data values of a particular type.
