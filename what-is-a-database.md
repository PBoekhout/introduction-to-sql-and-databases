# What is a Database?

A **database** is a place on a computer where information is stored in an organized way. Think of it like a digital filing cabinet that makes it easy to find, update, and manage lots of data. Instead of searching through messy piles of documents, a database lets you quickly look up exactly what you need.

For example, a store might use a database to keep track of all its products, how many items are in stock, and who buys them. A school could use one to store student information, grades, and schedules. Websites and apps often rely on databases to remember user accounts, shopping carts, messages, and more.

Because databases keep data neat and easy to access, they help businesses, organizations, and regular people work with information more efficiently. In short, a database helps turn large amounts of scattered data into well-organized information that’s ready when you need it.
